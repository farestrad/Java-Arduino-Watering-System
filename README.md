# API-WateringSystem
This project is an application programming interface (API) between Java and Arduino in order to make a plant watering system. The system automatically waters a plant using an Arduino Uno beginner kit. Once the sensor feels the soil is dry, the system starts the pump by itself and stops it when the soil is wet. Additionally, the code has a Java button that turns on the pump by hand. The code also generates a graph between the Arduino and Java and provides a buzzer for alerting when needed.

Getting Started
To get started with the API-WateringSystem project, you will need to set up the hardware components and download the required software.

Prerequisites
You will need the following components to set up the project:

Arduino Uno beginner kit
Moisture sensor
Water pump
Buzzer
LED
Jumper wires
Breadboard
USB cable
Installing
Clone the repository using the following command:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/API-WateringSystem.git
Upload the Arduino code to the Arduino Uno board using the Arduino IDE.
Run the Java code on your computer by opening it in an IDE of your choice and executing it.
Usage
The API-WateringSystem project is designed to automate the watering of plants. The system starts the pump automatically when the moisture sensor detects that the soil is dry. Additionally, you can manually turn on the pump using the Java button provided. The system generates a graph between the Arduino and Java, and it also has a buzzer for alerting when needed.
